# Solution

The challenge gives us a system of equations with 3 unknowns and our goal is solve this to get the key, decode the AES algorithm and receive the flag.

The first equation tells us that x is even, then the second equation tells us that y is even.

Let $x=2x_1, y=2y_1$, the system of equations becomes:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      x_1^2+2x_1y_1+2z=z^2+2y_1+2\\
      2x_1^2+y_1+z=2(2p+1)
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

Continuing, equation 1 tells us: $x_1\equiv z\pmod{2}$, and equation 2 also gives $x_1\equiv z\pmod{2}$. If $x_1, y_1, z$ were all even, the first equation would not hold because the left-hand side would be divisible by 4 while the right-hand side is $\equiv 2\pmod{4}$.

Therefore, they are all odd. Let $x_1=2u+1$, $y_1 = 2v-1$, $z=2w+1$. The system becomes:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      u^2+2uv=w^2\\
      4u^2+4u+v+w=2p
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

1. If $u=0$
   Then $w=0$ and $v=2p$, which yields the solution $(x, y, z) = (2, 8p-2, 1)$.

2. If $u\ne 0$

The first equation implies $u\mid w^2$, so we can write $u=a b^2$ and $w=a b c$ for some square-free positive integer $a$ and nonzero integers $b,c$.
The system becomes:

$$
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
      v=\dfrac{a(c^2-b^2)}{2}\\
      v=2p-4a^2b^4-4ab^2-abc
    \end{cases}\
\end{equation}
$$

From this we see that $a(c^2-b^2)$ is even, and $a(c^2-b^2)=4p-8a^2b^4-8ab^2-2abc$

Rearranging gives $a(b+c)^2=4p-8a^2b^4-8ab^2 \ \ (1)$

Since $a$ is square-free and divides the right-hand side, and $a>0$, we have $a\in\{1,2,p,2p\}$. Let $N=b+c$.

Then the equation can be rewritten as $(8ab^2+3)^2+8aN=32p+9$.

Because $a>0$ we get the bound $8ab^2+3\le\sqrt{32p+9}$, hence $1\le b^2\le\dfrac{\sqrt{32p+9}-3}{8a}$.

This implies $a\le\dfrac{\sqrt{32p+9}-3}{8}$.

One checks that for all $p>1$ the right-hand side is less than $p$, so $a<p$. Therefore $a$ can only be $1$ or $2$.

- If $a=1$ then from (1) we need $-8b^4-6b^2+4p$ to be a perfect square.
- If $a=2$ then from (1) we need $-16b^4-6b^2+2p$ to be a perfect square.

A small brute-force search over these cases is easy and yields the solution family $(x,y,z)=(4ab^2+2,2a(c^2-b^2)-2,2abc+1)$ with $c$ chosen so that the perfect-square condition holds (in the original derivation $c=\sqrt{k}-b$ for some integer $k$).
